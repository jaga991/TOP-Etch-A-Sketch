module

index.js
build.js, control.js, display.js 

build.js needs to build
-left side nav, right side todolist container, header
-todos div
-send results to control.js

control.js need to respond to
-event listeners from display.js and then send instructions to build.js (user adding todos, clicking on nav)
-received results from build.js and send it to display.js 
-error checks to be handled here

display.js needs to
-append all contents and any changes returned by control.js

therefore control.js needs to be able to interact with build.js and display.js, but build.js and display.js will never interact
